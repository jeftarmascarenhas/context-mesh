## 🚨 The Problem: Context Crisis

You're using AI to build faster. But three months later, your own code looks foreign.

**The Reality:**
- **70% of developers** struggle with understanding existing code ([Stack Overflow 2023](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2023/))
- **32% of developer time** wasted reconstructing lost context ([McKinsey Research](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/technology-media-and-telecommunications/our-insights/yes-you-can-measure-software-developer-productivity))
- **AI-generated code works**, but becomes impossible to maintain and scale

**This isn't just documentation** - it's a fundamental process problem. Context Mesh fixes it.

---

## 🎯 What is Context Mesh?

Context Mesh is a **process methodology** for AI-generated code development. It's not about using AI—it's about making AI-generated code maintainable and scalable through structured context preservation.

**Key Difference:**
- ❌ **Just using AI**: Fast development, but context disappears
- ✅ **Context Mesh**: Fast development WITH context preservation

**Context Mesh is NOT a replacement for Scrum or Agile** - it's a complementary framework specifically designed for AI-First development that works alongside existing methodologies like Scrum, Kanban, or DevOps.

## 🚀 Why Context Mesh?

### The Inversion

```
Traditional: Code → Documentation (often incomplete)
Context Mesh: Context → Code (always complete)
```

Traditional development treats code as primary and documentation as secondary. **AI-First Development inverts this paradigm**:

| Traditional | Context Mesh |
|------------|--------------|
| Code is primary | **Context is primary** |
| Documentation is secondary | **Code is manifestation of context** |
| Knowledge is static | **Knowledge evolves with system** |
| Decisions lose context | **Decisions preserve full context** |
| Human-AI friction | **Seamless human-AI collaboration** |

### What This Means for You

When context is primary:
- ✅ AI understands your architecture and patterns
- ✅ Code generation follows your decisions
- ✅ Code remains comprehensible months later
- ✅ New developers onboard in days, not weeks
- ✅ Changes are made with full context

## 📋 The 3-Step Context Mesh Workflow

Context Mesh is designed for simplicity and easy adoption, similar to Scrum. Just **3 simple steps**:

<div align="center">

![Context Mesh Flow](images/context-mesh-flow.png)

</div>

1. **🎯 Intent** - Define what to build and why (create context)
   - Plan what to build and why
   - Create feature intents, technical decisions
   - Prepare context for efficient building

2. **🔨 Build** - AI generates code following your context
   - AI generates code following your context
   - Human supervises and validates
   - Decisions documented as you build

3. **📚 Learn** - Update context with learnings
   - Update context to reflect actual code
   - Document learnings and outcomes
   - Refine intent for next iteration

**Each step preserves context** - no more lost decisions or forgotten rationale.

See [FRAMEWORK.md](FRAMEWORK.md) for complete details.

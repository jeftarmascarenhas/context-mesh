> "In the AI era, context isn't supplementary to code—it's the primary creation. Context Mesh makes this philosophy practical."

## 🎯 What is Context Mesh?

**Context Mesh** is an AI-First development framework that implements the [5 Philosophical Principles of AI-First Development](PRINCIPLES.md). Unlike traditional frameworks that treat documentation as an afterthought, Context Mesh treats **context as the primary artifact** and code as its manifestation.

**Context Mesh is NOT a replacement for Scrum or Agile** - it's a complementary framework specifically designed for AI-First development that works alongside existing methodologies like Scrum, Kanban, or DevOps.

## 🧠 The Core Philosophy

Traditional development treats code as primary and documentation as secondary. **AI-First Development inverts this paradigm**:

- ✅ **Context becomes the primary artifact**
- ✅ **Code becomes its manifestation**
- ✅ **Knowledge evolves alongside systems**
- ✅ **Decisions preserve their philosophical context**
- ✅ **Human-AI collaboration is seamless**

## 🚀 Why Context Mesh?

### The Context Crisis

When AI generates code rapidly, context often disappears:

- Teams waste [**32% of developer time**](https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/technology-media-and-telecommunications/our-insights/yes-you-can-measure-software-developer-productivity) reconstructing lost context
- New developer onboarding takes **3.5x longer** without preserved context
- Critical decisions lose their reasoning, leading to costly reversals
- AI assistance becomes dramatically less effective without historical context

### The Context Mesh Solution

Context Mesh solves the context crisis by:

1. **Living Context**: Central knowledge repository that evolves with your system
2. **Intent-Driven Development**: Everything flows from intent, not implementation
3. **Decision Architecture**: Every decision captures its "why" with full context
4. **Continuous Learning**: Production insights feed back into intent and context
5. **Human-AI Collaboration**: Clear patterns for seamless human-AI teamwork

## 📋 The 3-Step Context Mesh Workflow

Context Mesh is designed for simplicity and easy adoption, similar to Scrum:

1. **Intent** - Define intent and create living context
2. **Build** - AI builds with context, human supervises, decisions documented
3. **Learn** - Learn from results, update context, refine intent

Each step preserves context and feeds into the next, with explicit feedback loops from learning back to intent.

See [FRAMEWORK.md](FRAMEWORK.md) for complete details.

## 🎯 Key Features

### Living Context
- Central knowledge repository that evolves continuously
- Versioned context (using Git or similar)
- Links between intent, decisions, code, and learnings
- Always up-to-date and searchable

### AI-Human Collaboration
- Clear roles for humans and AI
- AI generates code based on context
- Human supervises and validates
- Seamless collaboration patterns

### Intent-Driven
- Everything flows from intent
- Architecture guided by purpose
- Decisions trace back to intent
- Intent refined based on learnings

### Decision Documentation
- Every significant decision captured with context
- Why decisions were made is preserved
- Alternatives considered are documented
- Outcomes update decisions

### Integration
- Works alongside Scrum, Kanban, DevOps
- Compatible with existing development workflows
- Simple to adopt and implement

## 🎓 The 5 AI-First Principles

Context Mesh implements these core principles:

1. **Context as Primary Creation** - Context is the primary artifact, code is its expression
2. **Intent-Driven Architecture** - Architecture flows from intent, not implementation
3. **Knowledge as Living Entity** - Knowledge evolves alongside systems
4. **Human-AI Collaborative Consciousness** - Seamless human-AI collaboration
5. **Contextual Decision Architecture** - Decisions preserve their "why" with full context

See [PRINCIPLES.md](PRINCIPLES.md) for detailed explanations.

Each step:
- Creates/updates context artifacts
- Preserves decisions and rationale
- Enables human-AI collaboration
- Feeds into the next step
- Contributes to the Living Context

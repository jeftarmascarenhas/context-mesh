# Context Mesh Integration Guide

Context Mesh is designed to work alongside existing methodologies like Scrum, Kanban, and DevOps. This guide shows how to integrate Context Mesh with your current workflow.

## Integration Philosophy

**Context Mesh is NOT a replacement** for Scrum, Kanban, or DevOps. Instead, it:
- **Complements** existing methodologies
- **Adds** context preservation and AI-First practices
- **Enhances** existing workflows with context awareness
- **Works** within your current structure

## Integration with Scrum

### Overview

Scrum provides the team structure and events. Context Mesh adds context preservation and AI-First practices to each Scrum event.

### Scrum Roles + Context Mesh

**Product Owner**:
- Leads Step 1 (Intent) for product intent
- Validates intent during Sprint Review
- Reviews learnings in Step 3 (Learn)

**Scrum Master**:
- Facilitates Context Mesh workflow
- Ensures context preservation
- Helps team follow Context Mesh practices

**Development Team**:
- Executes Context Mesh steps
- Preserves context throughout
- Collaborates with AI tools

### Scrum Events + Context Mesh

#### Sprint Planning (Step 1: Intent)

**Traditional Sprint Planning**:
- Review backlog
- Select items for sprint
- Create sprint goal
- Plan work

**With Context Mesh**:
- Review backlog items
- For each item, define intent (what and why)
- Create sprint goal aligned with intent
- Plan work with context preservation in mind

**Context Mesh Enhancements**:
- Each backlog item has clear intent
- Sprint goal traces to project intent
- Work planned with context in mind
- Context updates planned

#### Daily Scrum (Context Updates)

**Traditional Daily Scrum**:
- What did I do yesterday?
- What will I do today?
- Any impediments?

**With Context Mesh**:
- What did I do yesterday? (with context updates)
- What will I do today? (with context needs)
- Any impediments? (including context gaps)

**Context Mesh Enhancements**:
- Context updates shared
- Context gaps identified
- Decisions made documented
- AI tool usage discussed

#### Sprint Review (Step 3: Learn)

**Traditional Sprint Review**:
- Demo completed work
- Gather feedback
- Update backlog

**With Context Mesh**:
- Demo with intent validation
- Review context preservation
- Validate against original intent
- Extract learnings
- Update context with feedback

**Context Mesh Enhancements**:
- Work validated against intent
- Context completeness reviewed
- Learnings captured
- Feedback linked to context

#### Sprint Retrospective (Step 3: Learn)

**Traditional Sprint Retrospective**:
- What went well?
- What could improve?
- Action items

**With Context Mesh**:
- What went well? (with context insights)
- What could improve? (including context gaps)
- Action items (with context updates)
- Learnings added to context
- Insights feed back to Intent

**Context Mesh Enhancements**:
- Learnings captured in context
- Insights extracted and documented
- Context improvements identified
- Feedback loop to Intent initiated

### Scrum Artifacts + Context Mesh

#### Product Backlog

**With Context Mesh**:
- Items linked to intent
- Items linked to hypotheses
- Context requirements included
- Priority considers context needs

#### Sprint Backlog

**With Context Mesh**:
- Items with context links
- Context tasks included

### Kanban Practices + Context Mesh

**Visualize Work**:
- Add context status to cards
- Show context links
- Display context completeness

**Limit WIP**:
- Include context tasks in WIP limits
- Consider context capacity
- Balance code and context work

**Manage Flow**:
- Ensure context flows with code
- Identify context bottlenecks
- Optimize context flow

**Make Policies Explicit**:

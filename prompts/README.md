# Context Mesh - Prompt Templates

Ready-to-use prompts for initializing Context Mesh in different scenarios. These prompts help you bootstrap the Context Mesh structure quickly using AI, without needing to create files and folders manually.

> **💡 Philosophy**: Context Mesh doesn't require tools - just prompts and AI. These templates make it easy to get started by asking questions and analyzing your codebase.

**Use when**: You have an existing project and want to add Context Mesh

**What it does**:
- Analyzes your current codebase structure
- Extracts project intent from existing code
- Documents technical decisions already made
- Identifies coding patterns in your codebase
- Creates complete Context Mesh structure

**Time**: ~3-5 minutes (AI analyzes codebase automatically)

---

### 💼 [Freelance Project](freelance-project.md)
**Use when**: Starting a freelance or client project

**What it does**:
- Guides you through documenting client requirements
- Creates project-intent.md from client brief
- Sets up feature intents for each deliverable
- Prepares structure for decision tracking
- Documents acceptance criteria

**Time**: ~3-5 minutes (depending on brief complexity)

---

### ➕ [Add Feature](add-feature.md)
**Use when**: Adding a new feature to an existing Context Mesh project

**What it does**:
- Asks questions about the new feature
- Creates feature intent file
- Identifies if technical decisions are needed
- Links feature to existing context

## 💡 How These Prompts Work

### Interactive Prompts
Some prompts (New Project, Freelance Project, Add Feature) ask you questions:
- You answer as the AI asks
- AI creates context files based on your answers
- You can refine the generated files afterward

### Analytical Prompts
Some prompts (Existing Project) analyze your codebase:
- AI examines project structure automatically
- Extracts information from code and configuration
- Creates context files based on analysis
- You review and refine as needed

## 🎯 When to Use Each Prompt

| Scenario | Prompt | Why |
|----------|--------|-----|
| Starting fresh | [New Project](new-project.md) | Interactive setup for new projects |
| Adding to existing code | [Existing Project](existing-project.md) | Analyzes and documents what exists |
| Client work | [Freelance Project](freelance-project.md) | Documents requirements clearly |
| Adding features | [Add Feature](add-feature.md) | Maintains context for new work |

## 📝 Tips for Best Results

### For Interactive Prompts
- **Be specific** - More detail helps create better context
- **Think ahead** - Consider main features and tech stack
- **Start minimal** - You can always add more detail later
- **Review carefully** - Ensure generated files match your vision

### For Analytical Prompts
- **Review AI analysis** - Verify it correctly understood your project
- **Fill gaps** - Add any missing context the AI might have missed
- **Refine decisions** - Add more rationale or alternatives
- **Document patterns** - Ensure all important patterns are captured

### General Tips
- **Update continuously** - Context Mesh is a living structure
- **Follow workflow** - Use Intent → Build → Learn
- **Link everything** - Connect features, decisions, and learnings
- **Document learnings** - Add to evolution/ as you discover new patterns

---

## 🔄 After Using Prompts

1. **Review generated files** - Check accuracy and completeness
2. **Refine as needed** - Add details, adjust structure
3. **Start using** - Follow the 3-step workflow (Intent → Build → Learn)
4. **Update continuously** - Keep context aligned with code

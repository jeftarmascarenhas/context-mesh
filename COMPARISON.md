### Context Mesh
- **Focus**: Context preservation throughout lifecycle
- **Practices**: Context-driven development, AI collaboration
- **Context**: Living context, integrated with all practices
- **AI**: Built-in AI tool collaboration

### Key Differences
- **DevOps**: Focus on delivery pipeline and operations
- **Context Mesh**: Focus on context preservation and AI-First development
- **DevOps**: Automation and infrastructure
- **Context Mesh**: Context and knowledge management

### Compatibility
Context Mesh is **compatible with DevOps**. Context Mesh integrates with DevOps practices:
- Plan → Step 1 (Intent)
- Code/Build → Step 2 (Build)
- Deploy/Operate/Monitor → Step 3 (Learn)

See [INTEGRATION.md](INTEGRATION.md) for integration details.

### When to Use
- **DevOps**: Delivery pipeline, operations, infrastructure
